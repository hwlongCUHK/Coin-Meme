# Coin-Meme
The official dataset for paper "Bridging Culture and Finance: A Multimodal Analysis of Memecoins in the Web3 Ecosystem"

The Coin-Meme dataset consists of four modalities: Textual Descriptions, Visual Content, Community Interactions, and Financial Data. Textual Descriptions are the narratives associated with each memecoin. Visual Content includes the logo image of memecoin. Community Interactions encompass user comments. Financial Data consists of market-related metrics, including Market Capitalization and the Market Entry Time, which quantifies the speed at which a token gains liquidity and market presence on decentralized exchanges. The dataset includes all 3,751 memecoins that were created between January 2024 and November 2024 and subsequently moved to Raydium, providing a comprehensive overview of the memecoin ecosystem.

Data acquisition began by extracting token metadata from Dune.com using Pump.fun's program (6EF8rrecthR5Dkzon8Nwu78hRvfCKubJ14M5uBEwF6P) including token addresses, creation times, names, and creators. Token-specific URLs were generated by appending token addresses to the base URL (https://pump.fun/). A web scraping pipeline built with Selenium and Pandas automated the extraction of textual descriptions, token images, user comments, and financial data.

Following data acquisition, the dataset was cleaned to ensure accuracy and consistency. Text data (token descriptions and user comments) were preprocessed by converting text to lowercase, removing non-alphabetic characters (e.g., URLs), eliminating stopwords, and applying tokenization and lemmatization. Entries with missing descriptions or comments were excluded. Images were resized to 224x224 pixels to match ResNet50 input size, non-RGB images were converted to RGB, and corrupted or missing images were replaced with zero vectors. The time difference between token launch and being moved to Raydium was calculated as Market Entry Time.
